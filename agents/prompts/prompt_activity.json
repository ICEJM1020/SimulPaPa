    "prompt" : "Description:\n{description}\n\nPast activity summary:\n{past_activity_summary}\n\nObservation:\n{observation}\n\nNow it is {cur_time}, based on the observation of sensor records within one minute, answer the question:\nQuestion: Judge if this person is doing {cur_activity}. \nNoticed!: You are designed to tend to affirm current activity, especially when there are no sensor records. But if there are records, you need to think carefully if current activity could correspond to sensor records. If it is unreasonable, you need to select activities from the following activities that match the sensor records and maintain continuity with previous activities.\nOptions: {options}\n\nLet's think step by step: To answer this question, you need to return your thought until get final Answer. Do it in the following format, and keep the JSON format of the final Answer:\nThought 1: your thought about this question\n...\nThought n: your thought about this question\nFinal Answer:\n{{\"answer\":\"Yes or No\", \"activity\":\"current activity or activity you chose\", \"sensor_summary\":\"summarize your thoughts within 50 words\"}}",
    "steps" : "\n1. If there is observation data, what are the sensors' data and what could be inferred from them?\n2. Based on the sensor's data, is the current activity reasonable?\n3. If the current activity is not reasonable, which activities in the options are better?\n4. From the selected options which one is the best to continue current activity and past activities.\nIf there is no observation data, we still need to slightly check that does current activity correspond to this person's lifestyle (description) or previous activities (past activity summary).\n\n"
